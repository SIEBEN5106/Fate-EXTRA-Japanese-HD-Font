# This describes your textures and set up options for texture replacement.
# Documentation about the options and syntax is available here:
# https://www.ppsspp.org/docs/reference/texture-replacement

[options]
version = 1
hash = quick             # options available: "quick", xxh32 - more accurate, but much slower, xxh64 - more accurate and quite fast, but slower than xxh32 on 32 bit cpu's
ignoreMipmap = true      # Usually, can just generate them with basisu, no need to dump.
reduceHash = false       # Unsafe and can cause glitches in some cases, but allows to skip garbage data in some textures reducing endless duplicates as a side effect speeds up hashing as well, requires stronger hash like xxh32 or xxh64
ignoreAddress = false    # Reduces duplicates at the cost of making hash less reliable, requires stronger hash like xxh32 or xxh64. Basically automatically sets the address to 0 in the dumped filenames.

[games]
# Used to make it easier to install, and override settings for other regions.
# Files still have to be copied to each TEXTURES folder.

[hashes]
# Use / for folders not \\, avoid special characters, and stick to lowercase.
# See wiki for more info.

[hashranges]
# This is useful for images that very clearly have smaller dimensions, like 480x272 image. They'll need to be redumped, since the hash will change. See the documentation.
# Example: 08b31020,512,512 = 480,272
# Example: 0x08b31020,512,512 = 480,272

[filtering]
# You can enforce specific filtering modes with this. Available modes are linear, nearest, auto. See the docs.
# Example: 08d3961000000909ba70b2af = nearest

[reducehashranges]
# Lets you set texture sizes where the hash range is reduced by a factor. See the docs.
# Example:
512,512=0.5
